/*

This program takes an intger input from the user and stores it in variable n, then the while loop is iterated until n!=0 is false. In each iteration, the remainder when the value of n is divided by
10 is calculated, reversedNumber is computed and the value of n is decreased 10 fold. Finally, the reversedNumber ( which contains the reversed number) is printed on the screan
