/*
output is:
Eaten up! Yummy
Rotted away! Yuck

Chese count:0
asiago: gone
limburger: Gone
----------------

the first line is the result of calling asiago ->eat(),which prints one message.
 The second line is the result of calling limburger->rot(),which prints another message.
 The third line is simply the value in the variable CheeseCount.
 this variable was decremented once each time the computer called the OneMoreCheseGone function.
 Becasue the function was called twice,CheeseCount went from 2 to 1 to 0
 
 The final two lines shows the content of the status variable in the two objects.
